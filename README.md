## Installation

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments

You can find Conda environment files for the Deep Learning program in the `environments` folder. Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with `tensorflow-gpu` are labeled in the filename with "GPU".
